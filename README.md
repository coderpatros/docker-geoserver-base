# GeoServer Base Docker Container

Although you can use this to try out GeoServer this isn't really geared up for
unmodified production use.

For example, if you are using PostGIS you should really be using something
like Hikari JNDI configurations for database connection pooling and SSL.

Use this as a simple base image for building your own GeoServer docker
containers.

Available from Docker Hub as `coderpatros/geoserver-base`
